A tool for initializing your next.js applications with tailwind-css and typescript.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-tailwind-typescript

To get your project started, run:
```
npx next-tailwind-typescript [project-name]
```

Note: This will initialize the project in tailwind's 'jit' mode, with the purge files specified (for tree-shaking), as well as with tailwind included in css rather than javascript
